# ECE 517- Random_Process_and_Stochastic-In class notes

Here I organize the whole notes what the professor note on the whiteboard. I think most of important points you can find on the notes and those would help you understand the concepts well in a quick time. Also these notes can also help you finish the assignment due to many examples in these notes are related the homework exercises.
